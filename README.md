# Z420-Bios-update-V1-to-V2---Lessons-Learned
Issues and lessons learned from completing a V1 to V2 upgrade, including bricking and re-covering the server along the way.
There is alot of good and bad information out there. Some of which is not written clearly on what and why a bios upgrade will work or fail.
Here is my own account and findings, basics I wish I had figured out before bricking my server, with persistance however was able to re-instate it, fully working and upgraded. 

Alot of great work and information is already availiable which helped me immensly. Shout out to these two in particular:
