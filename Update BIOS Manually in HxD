## 1. Open Both Files

- Open your original BIOS dump from your chip (e.g., `mydump.bin`) in HxD.
- Open the **donor file** (e.g., a known-good boot block or ME region) in a second HxD window such as 3.96 (can be found in this repository).
    

---

## **2. Find the Correct Offsets**

- **Boot Block:**
    
    - Offset: `0xFF0000` to `0xFFFFFF` (last 64KB of a 16MB file)
        
- **ME Region:**
    
    - Offset: `0x005000` to `0x50FFFF` (about 5MB region)
        

---

## **3. Select and Copy the Donor Region**

- In the donor file’s HxD window:
    
    - Press `Ctrl+G` (Go To) and enter the **start offset** (e.g., `FF0000` for boot block).
        
    - Click at that location, then hold `Shift` and press `Ctrl+End` to select from that point to the end (for the boot block), or use `Ctrl+E` (Select Block) and enter the **end offset** (e.g., `FFFFFF`).
        
    - Press `Ctrl+C` to copy the selected bytes.
        

---

## **4. Select the Same Region in Your Dump**

- In your original BIOS dump’s HxD window:
    
    - Press `Ctrl+G` and enter the **start offset** (e.g., `FF0000`).
        
    - Use `Ctrl+E` (Select Block) and enter the **end offset** (e.g., `FFFFFF`).
        
    - The region will be highlighted.
        

---

## **5. Paste and Overwrite**

- With the region highlighted, press `Ctrl+V` to paste and overwrite the selection.
    
- HxD will replace the selected bytes with the donor region.
    

---

## **6. Save the Modified File**

- Save the modified BIOS dump under a new name (e.g., `mydump_mod.bin`) to preserve your original backup.
    

---

## **Quick Reference Table**

|Region|Start Offset|End Offset|Size|
|---|---|---|---|
|Boot Block|0xFF0000|0xFFFFFF|64 KB|
|ME Region|0x005000|0x50FFFF|~5 MB|

---

## **Tips**

- **Always keep a backup** of your original dump.
    
- Use the **“Go To” (Ctrl+G)** and **“Select Block” (Ctrl+E)** features for precision.
    
- Make sure the donor region is from a compatible source (same board family and version).

## **Visual Example (Boot Block Replacement)**

1. **In donor file:**
    
    - `Ctrl+G` → `FF0000`
        
    - `Ctrl+E` → End offset `FFFFFF`
        
    - `Ctrl+C`
        
2. **In your dump:**
    
    - `Ctrl+G` → `FF0000`
        
    - `Ctrl+E` → End offset `FFFFFF`
        
    - `Ctrl+V`
        
3. **Save as new file.**

If you need to replace the ME region, just use the offsets for ME instead.
